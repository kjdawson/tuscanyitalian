OVERVIEW 

This is a website that I built for a client in Houston Texas. They own an Italian Restaurant 
that has a strong web presence on review sites like Yelp and Urbanspoon but never took the
time to implement a website. They wanted to have their website to work on mobile and on desktop. 
They didn't want anything flashy or complex just a simple, clean site.

TECHNOLOGIES USED 

Majority of the site was built with HTML5 and CSS. HTML 5 because of the compatibility with
various devices, operating systems and browsers. Also using HTML5 ensures the least variability
when the pages are rendered. 

ANALYTICS

I have also included Google Analytics so the client can find out demographics of their web/mobile visitors.
I also included SEO for the site by becoming a marketing partner on Yelp, Urbanspoon, Google+ and Tripadvisor. 

-- SEO RESULTS

With the search phrase "Italian Restaurant Baytown" this website is listed first on Google.
